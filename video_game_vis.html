					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video game</a> is an electronic game that involves a user interacting with a 
						user interface or device to create audio and visual feedback from an electronic device. The earliest known video game was from 1947, 
						a "cathode-ray tube amusement device" by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, that allows a user to use an analog device to 
						control a dot to simulate a missle firing at targets. From then on, more inventions with the goal of playing a game were introduced, 
						giving way to the video game industry. Back then, video games could only be played on an arcade machine (How many people still remember those?!) 
						or consoles dedicated to games, which then evolved to games that can be played on a computer or mobile device, with enhanced graphics, 
						sound, and many more features. When video games were starting out, many people, mostly adults and parents, would argue that video games 
						were nothing but mere time-wasters and would not bring any benefits. Now, playing and developing video games have become something 
						more than just a hobby, it is a business, with its own market and industry. And with the research in technological fields such as 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual reality</a> and 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">augmented reality</a>, its growth only continues. This website aims to visualise
						and discuss some relevant topics relating to video games with the target audience being those that have reservations regarding video games 
						as a whole in the UK or those who wish to know more regarding it.

						The bar chart shows the importance of social aspect in online video game interactions worldwide where the data was collected using 
						a survey done by Accenture on 4000 gamers who play games on average four hours a week. As it shows, more than half of the 
						respondents agree on the social aspects of online gaming, shown with the 84% of respondents agreeing that video games 
						helped in connecting them with others with similar interests.

						Steam is a video game digital distribution site developed by Valve Corporation that allows for distribution of 
						third-party video games (Games not made by them), allowing easier access to different games. The chart above
						shows the number of new games released on Steam each year. Yes, that is not the total number of games that 
						the game distribution platform has each year, it is the number of games released on that particular year. <br>
						The increase shown in the chart is quite significant, with the number of games released greater than the previous year. 
						The only exception is 2019, likely due to COVID-19 disrupting the workflow of game developers, yet did not affect them 
						significantly as the number of games released was still close to the previous year's amount.

						The media market contains a variety of platforms that allows for content to be created, distributed, and consumed. This 
						ranges from traditional means (TV, radio, and printed mediums like books), to digital (social media and streaming services).
						The video game industry is no exception, being part of the digital media side of the market. Looking at the graph, video games 
						can be seen to have the 2nd highest market overall, only being outcompeted by TV & Video. When the COVID-19 pandemic happened, 
						tradional media markets were affected negatively with cinema suffering the greatest as it was difficult to film are maintaining 
						social distancing. Due to quarantine, most people would be staying in their homes and needed to do something to pass the time, 
						usually by playing games or watching shows or videos in streaming sites or social media. Hence, the increase in revenue rather 
						than decrease.

						Video games aren't excluded to only computers, they can be played on a variety of devices. The simplest way to define the 
						type of video game is the of device that they can be played on. These can be classified into 3 categories: Computers (PC), 
						Console (PS5, XBOX), and Mobile Phones. The chart above shows the total revenue made by video games based on device type in
						the year 2022. Mobile games managed to make a total of $103.5 billion, more than PC and Console games combined. As phones 
						nowadays are powerful enough to be a personal home computer that can be carried anywhere, games end up becoming more 
						accessible to play.

						As stated previously, the video game industry has the second larget market in the media sector, and with that, the revenue 
						it generates is able to help boost a country's economy. The chart above shows the 
						five countries with the highest revenue generated from their video game industry on digital games alone, excluding the physical 
						games. As it can be seen, China has the highest revenue from it's game industry followed by the US. For the remaining three 
						countries, even when combined, their total revenue is unable to amount to the US. Although it has the lowest revenue out of the 
						five, the UK still manages to be in the top five. But just how much does the UK's video game industry contribute to its economy? 
						This section aims to visualise and discuss the data regarding it.

						The chart above shows the tax revenue generated by the video game industry from the year 2011 to 2023. Due to the lack of information,
						no data was able to be found for the year 2016, hence is not shown in the graph. Due to the impact of COVID-19, a lot of data on the worlds' economy, 
						especially the UK, was limited. The years marked with asteriks (*) are data over a certain period. For the year "2018/20", it indicates 
						the period between November 2018 to April 2020. For "2020/21", from April 2020 to December 2021. Finally, for "2021/23", it is from 
						December 2021 to April 2023. Although the chart does show an increasing trend, due to the limited amount of data and combination 
						of the yearly data, it's hard to determine the actual amount for each year during the pandemic.

					<h2>Games as a Business</h2>
					<p>
						With how much revenue the video game industry generates, the question now is: "How does the video game industry make money?". It 
						does not simply earn money just by selling games as this section will show. Just like any other 
						industry, the video game market is a business, with different models that allow companies and developers to generate 
						revenue with their games.

					<p>
						This chart shows the types of business models used by developers to monetize their video games and their popularity among them. 
						A survey was used to collect the data on which business models were used by game developers for their games. The survey 
						allows for multiple models to be chosen by the respondents, hence the percentage values adding up to more than 100%. This 
						is mainly because games usually use more than one business model in their games rather than just one. One example is 
						the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/">Call of Duty</a> franchise where not only do the games use a 
						digital premium model, they also have paid Downloadable Content (DLC) not included in the standard game 
						(<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/evolving-business-models-for-the-top-game-brands">Source</a>). 
						When it comes to digital premium games, which is selling a digital game, it is the most popular among developers, 
						followed by free-to-download games.

						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">Free-To-Play</a> or Free-To-Download (F2P) games are games that do not 
						require the user to pay any money to obtain or play the game. 
						However, if that is the case, it can be easily assumed that these tyes of games do not make any money for the developers. 
						Based on this chart, this is not the case as it shows the worldwide revenue of games that are F2P from 2018 to 2024. This 
						is because games will typically use another business model along with the F2P model to generate income. For example, 
						<a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2</a> is a F2P computer game that contains items, usually hats, 
						in the game that can be bought by the player using real money to change their characters' appearance. Based on the chart, 
						F2P mobile games generate the most revenue compared to PC and console games every year. The reason for F2P console games 
						having very low revenue compared to PC and mobile is that most console games adopt a digital premium model.

					<h2>Free-To-Play Example (Genshin Impact)</h2>
					<P>
						F2P games have become very common in the video game industry, appearing mostly in the mobile and PC areas. As players can easily 
						download these games and play straight away without the need to pay, game companies have to use one or more business models to 
						monetize the game, each with their upsides and downsides. The most common in many small F2P mobile games is the use of advertising 
						of other games or products (Product placement) to generate ad revenue. The problem from this is that if the company uses too many, 
						players can get frustrated if ads pop up too frequently which disrupts their gameplay. Another common method, typically seen 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">Gacha</a> games, is the use of paid in-game currencies. In-game currencies 
						can be earned by playing the game, but players can pay money to buy more of the game's currency in order to progress faster in 
						the game or get better items quicker. If the currency is difficult to obtain and players are required to pay, the game can 
						be considered by players as non-F2P-friendly which can damage the game's reception. Hence, when developing F2P games, companies 
						have to account for many factors to balance monetization and player satisfaction. This section visualises one example of a 
						very successful F2P game called <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en">Genshin Impact</a>, which is a free-to-play 
						action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo in China on the 28th September 2020.

						After the release of Genshin Impact, it did not take long for players to get into the game and start putting money into it. In just 13 days, 
						the mobile version of it managed to earn $100 million in player spending, becoming part of the top 5 fastest mobile games to reach that milestone. 
						This took a step further when it also became the fastest mobile game to reach $1 billion in player spending. Previously, the 
						fastest mobile game that reached the 1 billion milestone was Pokemon GO at 9 months, and Genshin Impact was able to beat it by 3 months.

						The chart above shows the In-App Purchase (IAP) revenue generated by Genshin Impact from 2020 to 2024. As the game was released late September 2020, 
						the yearly IAP revenue for 2020 only accounts for October, November, and December, while the quarterly chart excludes the September revenue. 
						For 2024, as the data collected only accounts for January, February, and March, the year 2024 in the yearly revenue chart is considered incomplete. 
						The years with not enough data are marked with an asterisk (*). <br>
						Genshin Impact had the highest IAP revenue in 2022, generating $1367.61 million in total. In October 2020, a month into its release, Genshin Impact 
						had the highest IAP revenue of 172.16 and no other months have managed to surpass it. When looking at the quarterly and monthly IAP revenue charts, 
						there is a notable downward trend even though there are months where the revenue is higher than the previous year. This is for those increases, 
						it is highly likely due to the game receiving a new big update or expansion, making players return.
